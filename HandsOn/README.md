Hands-on 2015-2016
==================

This is the directory where students have to upload their materials related to the hands-on for course 2016-2017.

# Use of GitHub

* Each group designates a leader
* The leader forks the main repository
* Group members fork the leader repository

# GitHub structure

* All the hands-on materials under the “HandsOn” directory
* Each group will create a directory in github for uploading all the materials of the hands-on. 
* Group directories must follow the format "GroupXX" where "XX" is the number of the group (e.g., "Group01"). Group numbers will be created in a first come-first served basis, starting from number 1 and giving consecutive numbers.

# Group directory (/HandsOn/GroupXX) contents

* /members.html - An HTML document with the names and GitHub users of the members of the group 
* /csv/* - CSV files with the datasets selected 
* /requirements/datasetRequirements.html - An HTML document that discusses whether the selected datasets satisfy the requirements. All the requirements must be satisfied by the datasets with the exception of the optional requirements; for these, the degree of satisfaction must be discussed
* /requirements/applicationRequirements.html - An HTML document that specifies the requirements of the application that will be built, with user interface mock-ups
